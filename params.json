{"name":"D00x","tagline":"A cross-language cross-target software platform","body":"## Software Development Is Moving Slowly\r\nI'm a recovering professional software developer, also known as a hobbyist. I got a CS degree and had a twelve year as a passionate software developer. I wrote code at work, then came home and wrote some more. But my life and career has taken another direction, now I'm left only writing software with a very limited amount of time.\r\n\r\nI still read about the latest news, but I see it differently. Technologies are oddly tied together - [Java][1] and the [JVM][2] as an example. [Node][3] and [Rails][4] are stepping stones - demonstrations of great concepts - that are incorrectly executed as new languages. [Docker][5] and [containers][6] are an iteration of [virtual machines][7], but are not going to be the end of [DevOps][8]. I no longer have time for these intermediate steps - just tell me when the concepts have been integrated into superior environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Language Inefficiencies\r\nWhy can't I use Rails with [SQLAlchemy][9]? They're both great pieces of an application, but because one is written in [Ruby][10] and the other is written in [Python][11], we as an industry need to duplicate one (or both) of them in order to use these two great libraries. The duplications have their own problems and bugs, develop on their own paths, and often wind up worse. Nowhere is this more evident than when a new language (such as [Golang][12]) is introduced. Every great concept that's been used in other languages needs to be rewritten in that language. The manpower used by the industry is impressive but ultimately wasted.\r\n\r\n## Platform Inefficiencies\r\nThe one project I have left is [Podax][13]. It's an open source podcast player for [Android][14] that varies between mediocre and very good, depending on the release. It's written in Java, as is almost every other Android app today. Asking whether I want to write the app in Java as opposed to another language is a silly question because there aren't any other realistic options. Other options exist, but the are going to make the app more difficult for me to work on and extremely difficult for any potential contributors. Why does this have to be the case?\r\n\r\n## Making The Final Paradigm Possible\r\nWhere is software development going to be in 50 years? Are we going to need to duplicate efforts to bring our software to our customers on different platforms? Are there going to continue to be barriers stopping us from using libraries created in different languages? Is it going to be written as text?\r\n\r\nHere's a better question: where do we want software development to be in 50 years? Let's start moving in that direction. That's what d00x is.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.java.com/en/download/whatis_java.jsp\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine\r\n  [3]: http://nodejs.org/\r\n  [4]: http://rubyonrails.org/\r\n  [5]: https://www.docker.com/\r\n  [6]: https://linuxcontainers.org/\r\n  [7]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine\r\n  [8]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps\r\n  [9]: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/\r\n  [10]: https://www.ruby-lang.org\r\n  [11]: https://www.python.org/\r\n  [12]: http://golang.org/\r\n  [13]: http://github.com/thasmin/Podax\r\n  [14]: http://www.android.com/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
