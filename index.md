# What's Wrong With Developing Software?
There are a lot of problems with the way software is created these days. Some of them are so endemic to the software industry that they're not evn brought up as problems. d00x is a project to expose and fix these problems so the software industry can move forward.

Here is a small list of issues that the industry is currently experiencing:

* language boundaries prevent great software from being used in many situations
* common platforms are only reachable from different platforms
* massive amounts of programmer effort that are wasted:
	- rewriting and fixing code when a sufficient library is available in another language
	- duplicating software when creating the same application for different platforms
	- learning new languages
	- writing code in suboptimal langues

There's no reason to let this continue. We can fix these problems. d00x will start.
